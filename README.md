# formik
This form serves as a signup page for users to fill out an email and password. If the fields are not completely filled out, the user will be alerted of what they need to fill out to complete the signup form correctly. 

## How to Run?
Enter in your information and the form will give the user immediate feedback. 

## Roadmap of Future Improvements
This application would be more user friendly if the user was alerted when a subject field was filled out correctly. It will not have an alert in red, but having a message come up as "success" in green would add a more friendly UI to this sign up page.

## License Information
This project was created as part of the MIT xPRO Full Stack Development program. Formik, babel, and react were used.
